## Installation
      
From the appropriate directory in the terminal run `node server` and then you can interact with your database all day in Insomnia or Postman or whatever you prefer.  And if you'd like my seed data, you can run `node seeds/seeds` from the appropriate directory in the terminal.
      
## Usage
      
To teach me the ins and outs of NoSQL and MongoDB working in tandem - real world necessity for this application is minimal.
